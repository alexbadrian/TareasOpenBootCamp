# TareasOpenBootCamp
My first time programming In Java, and my very first repository on GitHub.
On this project im only completing tasks of OpenBootCamp website.
On this task i had to make an addition function and then create a class (vehicle) where i specified the number of doors it has and then by another function i added one extra door. 
As result program must show the adition of these 3 numbers and then also show the number of doors the car has after adding one extra door.


Thanks!
